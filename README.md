### Hi there, i am Alexis! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on "TEG", which is a set of reinforcement learning environments and tools for develop smart controllers for robot manipulators, it started as my bachelor thesis but now, I want to convert it in a open source project for the community. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Reinforcement Learning, deep learning applied to Robotics, Electronics and music.

Also I am creating my personal website where I will show my learning notes and cool projects that I do, <a href="https://alexfm101.github.io/"> check it out</a> and tell me about it.
