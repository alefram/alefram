### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<!-- - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on "TEG", which is a set of reinforcement learning environments and tools for develop smart controllers for robot manipulators, it started as my bachelor thesis but now, I want to convert it in a open source project for the community.  -->

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Reinforcement Learning, Deep learning applied to Robotics, WebDev and music. Also I work as a software developer in PHP/Laravel applications.
